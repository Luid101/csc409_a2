1. URL shortener with Docker
    - We could add more replicas of our URLShortner to distribute the load across multiple machines.
    - We could add more Redis containers on other systems to take advantage of more RAM.
    - To scale the application beyond the capacity of the cache we could store all URLs in the PostgreSQL server and in Redis only the most recently accessed
    to improve performance. 

2. MD5 breaker with Spark and Scala
    It takes one machine 3m20s to find a pre-image of length 8, which requires 10^7 hashes. That equals to 50,000 hashes per second. 
    20 lab machines could perform 50k * 20 = 1M hash/s. To find pre-image of length 15, our 20 lab machines would take 10^14 / 10^6 = 10^8s ~ 27,700h ~ ~ 3.15years

3. Link extractor that creates a graph of links for a specified URL
